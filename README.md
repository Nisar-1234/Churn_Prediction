# Telecom_Churn_Prediction

  This case study aims at predicting the customer churn rate in Telecom Industry. Compared to earlier days where there was no provision to switch from one service provider to another, the customers nowadays can easily switch from one service provider to another if they are not satisfied with the service of the current operator. Given that the process is simpler and not time consuming, it becomes inevitable for the telecom companies to retain their customers by providing a good customer experience.

  Here we are given dataset of South Asian market for the months of June, July, August and September. The data set contains information such as Mobile number, Circle ID, Voice usage, Data usage, Recharge amount, Recharge date, etc. Using this info, we can understand the difference in usage pattern of customers. For a Satisfied customer, there would not be much of difference in the usage pattern throughout all the 4 months whereas for a unhappy customer, we could see the usage would have been reduced as we move from June to September. Here our objective is
  1) To predict the churn rate i.e. the percentage of customers who are on the verge of switching to other operator as they are not happy      with the services provided by the current operator.
  2) To identify the key reasons on why the customers are not happy with the current experience.
  3) To build Predictive Machine Learning Models to achieve the above objectives.
